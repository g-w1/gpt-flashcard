<br><b>Title of Project:</b> Using Large Language Models to Enhance Spaced Repetition Learning
<br><b>You are being asked to volunteer to participate in this science project.</b> If you would like to participate, please sign in the appropriate area below.
<br><b>Purpose of the project:</b> The purpose of this study is to evaluate if Large Language Models can replace humans in creating good flashcards for use in spaced repetition learning.
<br><b>If you participate, you will be asked to:</b> Take a survey and assessment at the beginning of the study. Do online flashcards daily during the study and take an assessment at the end of the study.
<br><b>Time required for participation:</b> 5-10 minutes every day during the study. The study will last for 4 weeks for every participant. You may be asked to write flashcards or to not do flashcards at all.
<br><b>Potential Risks of Study:</b> There are no risks associated with this study.
<br><b>Benefits:</b> The participants will learn a valuable skill of spaced repetition flashcards and they will learn information about various subjects.
<br><b>How confidentiality will be maintained:</b> All of the data will be on a secure server. I will only analyze anonymized data from the database from the server. I will not analyze any personal information.
<br><b>If you have any questions about this study, feel free to contact:</b>
