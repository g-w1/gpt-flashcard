[{"question": "What are the main stages of the cell cycle?", "answer": "The main stages of the cell cycle are Intephase (G1, S, G2), and the Mitotic phase (Prophase, Metaphase, Anaphase, Telophase, and Cytokinesis)."}, {"question": "What is the purpose of mitosis in cells?", "answer": "Mitosis is used for growth and to replace worn out cells."}, {"question": "What is the difference between mitosis and meiosis?", "answer": "Mitosis results in two genetically identical daughter cells, whereas meiosis results in four genetically different daughter cells."}, {"question": "What is the main focus of the study of ecology?", "answer": "Ecology focuses on the interactions between organisms and their environment."}, {"question": "What is the role of a producer in a food chain?", "answer": "Producers, such as plants, provide the energy that starts the food chain."}, {"question": "How does the predator-prey relationship affect the population size of both species?", "answer": "Predators reduce the prey population, and when prey is scarce, the predator population decreases. When predator numbers are low, the prey population can increase."}, {"question": "What is the main premise of Darwin's Theory of Evolution?", "answer": "Darwin's Theory of Evolution states that species change over time through the process of natural selection."}, {"question": "What are the three key laws of Mendelian Genetics?", "answer": "The three laws are: the Law of Segregation, the Law of Independent Assortment, and the Law of Dominance."}, {"question": "Who is the scientist behind the system of binomial nomenclature and what does it involve?", "answer": "Carl Linnaeus established binomial nomenclature. It involves naming species using a system with two parts: the genus name and the species descriptor."}, {"question": "What are the seven levels of taxonomy, in order?", "answer": "The seven levels are: Kingdom, Phylum, Class, Order, Family, Genus, and Species."}, {"question": "What is the basic structure of a virus?", "answer": "A virus is made up of a core of genetic material, either DNA or RNA, surrounded by a protein coat called a capsid."}, {"question": "What is a notable characteristic of the coronavirus structure?", "answer": "Coronavirus has spike proteins on its surface giving it a crown-like appearance under an electron microscope, hence the name 'corona'."}]
